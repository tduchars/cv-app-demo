## THIS APP DISPLAYS SOME PROJECTS I HAVE WORKED ON

### CREATED DUE TO THE INABILITY ON GITHUB TO LINK MORE THAN 6 PROJECTS

The simplest way to see my portfolio app in action is to click the link for a short 30 second, demonstration video ...

LINK TO VIDEO HERE WHEN COMPLETE

If you want to use my portfolio app live you will need to clone and run locally with an ios simulator or scan a device through the expo QR code.
(Currently optimised for ios but functions well on both operating systems.)

## SCROLL PORTFOLIO APP

The 'scroll app' in which the projects are displayed I also built using mostly the
features mentioned below:

1. Uses mostly Y indexes to adjust profile image size and text size when scrolling.

2. Also when tapping the header it will automatically scroll you to the top of
   the screen using the scrollview reference.

3. Interpolates a scrollY animation in order to adjust the heights of the header, name and image.
   Then sneaks a white name on top of the now smaller header ready to continue scrolling and
   maximise screen real estate when looing at more content.
