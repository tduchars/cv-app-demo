FANCY SCROLLER:

1. Uses mostly Y indexes to adjust profile image size and text size when scrolling.

2. Also when tapping the header it will automatically scroll you to the top of
   the screen using the scrollview reference.

3. Interpolates a scrollY animation in order to adjust the heights of the header, name and image.
   Then sneaks a white name on top of the now smaller header ready to continue scrolling and
   maximise screen real estate when looing at more content.
